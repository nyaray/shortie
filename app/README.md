# Shortie

To start shortie:

* Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
* Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * If you've deployed the stack at the top-level of this project, you can run ecto.setup against that database.
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
